# Learn CSS

I am using this repo to save my work as I brush up on CSS by following [this course](https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA?si=jUk0oBv8MgliTzwO) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

** Note: if you just read my code, you'd miss a lot. Many principles and rules explained in the course are not reflected in the final form of the code. **

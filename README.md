# Learn CSS

I am using this repo to save my work as I brush up on CSS by following [this 11 hour course](https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA?si=jUk0oBv8MgliTzwO) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [@gitdagray](https://github.com/gitdagray/css_course).

**Note: This code does not represent a comprehensive overview of what is covered in the course. Many rules and principles which are experimented with are not contained in the final code.**

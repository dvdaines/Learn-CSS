# Learn CSS

I am using this repo to save my work as I brush up on CSS by following [this 11 hour course](https://youtu.be/OXGznpKZ_sA?si=jUk0oBv8MgliTzwO) from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

**Note: This code does not represent a comprehensive overview 
of CSS. The course teaches numerous rules and principles which are experimented with in code but are not contained in the final code.**
